        </h3>
        <p>
            AspecScire was an early-stage drone data analytics startup, initially focused on surveying, mapping, and
            construction, and later expanded to solar, infrastructure inspections, mining, agriculture,
            and forestry. In this dynamic environment, I played a key role in designing and building a wide range of
            features for their SaaS platform, Vimana, creating a versatile self-serve platform for customers, and
            additionally developed tailored solutions to meet the unique needs of various clients.
        </p>
        <h4 class="job-title">Full-stack Developer</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Wrote <u>python</u> scripts to automate the processing of large datasets of drone imagery using
                photogrammetry
                software, to create 3D models &amp; point clouds, orthomosaics and digital elevation models.
                These outputs were then used to create interactive maps &amp; 3D visualisations, and perform volumetric
                analysis &amp; other
                measurements.
                <ul>
                    <li>Wrote scripts to automate the processing of drone imagery using <u>Agisoft PhotoScan</u>. Designed,
                        tested, and implemented different methods to improve performance by 8x, while preserving
                        accuracy and quality.
                    </li>
                    <li>Wrote scripts using <u>Mapbox</u> APIs to upload orthomosaics and other outputs for
                        visualization.
                        Optimized uploads to make datasets available for visualization 40% faster.
                    </li>
                    <li>Wrote scripts using <u>python-gdal</u>, <u>shapely</u> and other GIS tools to create custom
                        rasters and vectors when required for a customer's use case.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Owned the front-end codebase and user-facing functionality, first in <u>Angular</u> and later in <u>React</u>,
                for the
                drone analytics platform, Vimana.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        I worked on the first version of our web platform, Vimana. I worked on adding a file uploader,
                        using <u>AngularJS</u>, and integrating it with our backend APIs.
                        I also added a map to visualize the location of where the uploaded files were captured, using
                        <u>MapboxGL JS</u>.
                    </li>
                    <li>Used <u>antd</u> for UI components, <u>redux</u> for global state management,
                        <u>react-joyride</u> for user
                        tutorials, and <u>react-router</u> for routing. Updated <u>webpack</u> & migrated our custom
                        webpack config to
                        add Hot Module Replacement, improving build and refresh times.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Once we saw the demand for a more powerful platform, we re-designed and re-architected the
                platform, and I was primarily responsible for the front-end.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We used <u>React</u>, <u>Redux</u>, and <u>Ant Design</u> to create a powerful platform, with a
                        focus on user
                        experience, where users could upload and process drone data, visualize the outputs on a map, and
                        create annotations.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Implemented custom map interactions and visualization for Geospatial Data. Initially, we used
                        <u>MapboxGL</u> to visualize the data, and used <u>Sketchfab</u> &amp; <u>Potree</u> to support
                        3D visualization.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Eventually, we migrated away from <u>Mapbox</u> and implemented our own tiling service. I used
                        <u>OpenLayers</u> to create our own interactive map visualization, with support for tiling and
                        backwards compatibility with <u>Mapbox</u> datasets.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Using our new tiling service and the performance improvements from <u>WASM</u>
                        modules written in <u>rust</u> we created, I moved the measurements logic to work on the
                        front-end, to reduce costs and improve performance.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Created a workflow end-to-end to enable users to upload CAD design files, manually georeference
                        them during upload using <u>OpenLayers</u>, and visualize them on the map.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Wrote &amp; maintained the APIs for our web platform Vimana. I owned features from gathering business
                requirements, to database & API design, to implementation, documentation and testing.
                <ul>
                    <li>Built multiple <u>python-flask</u> microservices to support a mobile app, and platform features.
                        Implemented an upload micro-service for drone data, a measurement service to enable distance,
                        elevation, area and volume measurements on our interactive maps, and more.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Created a <u>python-flask</u> microservice to handle object detection and other tasks, able to
                        handle
                        inputs from multiple sources, such as automated detections from our in-house ML models, and
                        manual annotations from our platform.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Created an issues feature for users to mark problems on the maps or other visualizations,
                        have conversations about it, classify them, and share it with other users. Added pagination
                        support for issues, and their associated comments.
                    </li>
                    <li>Re-architected & migrated APIs from <u>python-django</u> to <u>Java Spring</u>, and finally to
                        <u>Rust</u>, to improve performance and maintainability.
                    </li>
                    <li>Implemented email notifications via <u>mailchimp</u>, to keep our customers up-to-date with the
                        state of their data, processing status, and about any issues with their data.
                    </li>
                    <li>Used <u>Swagger</u> & <u>OpenAPI</u> to create internal API documentation.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Managed infrastructure &amp; deployments of the platform on <u>GCP</u> and <u>AWS</u>, using <u>Kubernetes</u>,
                <u>Docker</u>, and
                <u>Jenkins</u>.
                Migrated the platform from GCP to be platform-agnostic to allow for on-premise deployments.
                <ul>

                    <li>Used <u>Docker</u> to containerize various services, and <u>Docker Compose</u> to orchestrate
                        them locally,
                        and <u>Kubernetes</u> for services in production.
                    </li>
                    <li>Migrated the database from <u>Google Cloud Datastore</u> to <u>PostgreSQL</u>, and generalized
                        access to file storage via S3-like APIs.
                    </li>
                    <li>Used <u>AWS Sagemaker</u> to run ML inference on our dataset.</li>

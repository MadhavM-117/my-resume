        </h3>
        <p>
            AspecScire was an early-stage drone data analytics startup, initially focused on surveying, mapping, and
            construction, and later expanded to solar, infrastructure inspections, mining, agriculture,
            and forestry. In this dynamic environment, I played a key role in designing and building a wide range of
            features for their SaaS platform, Vimana, creating a versatile self-serve platform for customers, and
            additionally developed tailored solutions to meet the unique needs of various clients.
        </p>
        <h4 class="job-title">Full-stack Developer</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Wrote Python scripts to automate the processing of large datasets of drone imagery using photogrammetry
                software, to create 3D models &amp; point clouds, orthomosaics and digital elevation models.
                These outputs were then used to create interactive maps &amp; 3D visualisations, and perform volumetric
                analysis &amp; other
                measurements.
                <ul>
                    <li>Wrote scripts to automate the processing of drone imagery using Agisoft PhotoScan. Designed,
                        tested, and implemented different methods to improve performance by 8x, while preserving
                        accuracy and
                        quality.
                    </li>
                    <li>Wrote scripts using Mapbox APIs to upload orthomosaics and other outputs for visualization.
                        Optimized uploads to make datasets available for visualization 40% faster.
                    </li>
                    <li>Wrote scripts using python-gdal, shapely and other GIS tools to create custom rasters and
                        vectors when required for a customer's use case.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Owned the front-end codebase and user-facing functionality, first in Angular and later in React, for the
                drone analytics platform, Vimana.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        I worked on the first version of our web platform, Vimana. I worked on adding a file uploader,
                        using AngularJS, and integrating it with our backend APIs.
                        I also added a map to visualize the location of where the uploaded files were captured, using
                        MapboxGL JS.
                    </li>
                    <li>Used antd for UI components, redux for global state management, react-joyride for user
                        tutorials, and react-router for routing. Updated webpack & migrated our custom webpack config to
                        add Hot Module Replacement, improving build and refresh times.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Once we saw the demand for a more powerful platform, we re-designed and re-architected the
                platform, and I was primarily responsible for the front-end.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We used React, Redux, and Ant Design to create a powerful platform, with a focus on user
                        experience, where users could upload and process drone data, visualize the outputs on a map, and
                        create annotations.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Implemented custom map interactions and visualization for Geospatial Data. Initially, we used
                        MapboxGL to visualize the data, and used Sketchfab &amp; Potree to support 3D visualization.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Eventually, we migrated away from Mapbox and implemented our own tiling service. I used
                        OpenLayers to create our own interactive map visualization, with support for tiling and
                        backwards compatibility with Mapbox datasets.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        With the support of our new tiling service and the performance improvements from WASM modules we
                        created, I moved the measurements logic to work on the front-end, to reduce costs and improve
                        performance.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Created a workflow end-to-end to enable users to upload CAD design files, manually georeference
                        them during upload using OpenLayers, and visualize them on the map.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Wrote &amp; maintained the APIs for our web platform Vimana. I owned features from gathering business
                requirements, to database & API design, to implementation, documentation and testing.
                <ul>
                    <li>Built multiple <u>python-flask</u> microservices to support a mobile app, and platform features.
                        Implemented an upload micro-service for drone data, a measurement service to enable distance,
                        elevation, area and volume measurements on our interactive maps, and more.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Created a <u>python-flask</u> microservice to handle object detection and other tasks, able to
                        handle
                        inputs from multiple sources, such as automated detections from our in-house ML models, and
                        manual annotations from our platform.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Created an issues feature, where users could create issues on the maps or other visualizations,
                        have conversations about it, classify them, and share it with other users. Added pagination
                        support for issues, and their associated comments.
                    </li>
                    <li>Re-architected & migrated APIs from <u>python-django</u> to <u>Java Spring</u>, and finally to
                        <u>Rust</u>, to
                        improve performance and maintainability.
                    </li>
                    <li>Implemented email notifications via <u>mailchimp</u>, to keep our customers up-to-date with the
                        state of their data, processing status, and about any issues with their data.
                    </li>
                    <li>Used Swagger & OpenAPI to create internal API documentation.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Managed infrastructure &amp; deployments of the platform on GCP and AWS, using Kubernetes, Docker, and
                Jenkins.
                Migrated the platform from GCP to be platform-agnostic to allow for on-premise deployments.
                <ul>

                    <li>Used Docker to containerize various services, and Docker Compose to orchestrate them locally,
                        and Kubernetes for services in production.
                    </li>
                    <li>Migrated the database from Google Cloud Datastore to PostgreSQL, and generalized access to file
                        storage via S3-like APIs.
                    </li>
